# CRUD-Operation-in-Java-Using-JDBC-SQL

In this project, I built a Java Application that runs on a linux environment. The java program uses the JDBC driver and a singleton pattern. The JDBC driver accesses a MySQL database hosted on the linux server and implements the CRUD functionalities for a user to access the Database using the console. The application furthermore has validation checks to ensure minimal user entry errors.
